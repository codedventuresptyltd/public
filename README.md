# CommerceBridge Examples

Practical code examples for building with the CommerceBridge ecosystem.

## What's Here

This repository contains **working code examples** that demonstrate how to build workers, integrate with the bridge, and create commerce applications.

## Structure

```
examples/
├── workers/          # Worker implementations
├── bridge/           # Bridge integration patterns
├── engagements/      # Engagement creation and management
├── translators/      # Data translation examples
├── integrations/     # External service integrations
└── end-to-end/       # Complete application flows
```

## Quick Start

Each example includes:
- ✅ Working code with comments
- ✅ Configuration examples
- ✅ Expected inputs/outputs
- ✅ Common variations

## Philosophy

**Code, not docs.** These examples show real implementations you can copy, modify, and deploy.

## Running Examples

Most examples are standalone Node.js/TypeScript files:

```bash
npm install
npm run example:worker-basic
npm run example:engagement-create
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Access to CommerceBridge instance
- Environment variables configured

See each example's header for specific requirements.
